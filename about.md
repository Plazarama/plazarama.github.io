_**What is PLAZARAMA?**_
_Plazarama is an online multiplayer and multiscreen game._

So I want you all to imagine that you want to play a game with another player in the same mobile phone. However the screen is too small for both parties, so, what would happen if you separate the screen from the controller? This is the basic idea behind our project, separating the actual game from the controller.
Plazarama mix of games which will have something to please everyone. These games can vary from maths games to language games, or more traditional games like general knowledge. 

**So How Does Plazarama Work?**
We will use a laptop as the main screen for the game. The players will use their mobile phones as their controllers connecting them to the laptop that works as a Hub. 
So far it can host between two users at the same time. For example, in the case of the Quiz game the screen will show the questions and each user in his mobile will have a set of questions, so they will compete for the correct answer.
