##Week 6

### _Midterm Break_

Today we met and decided on a final logo for Plazarama. I drew out our logo on illustrator. We discussed Logos etc for each game and more design ideas. 

We discussed which final 6 games we were going to have. Our games will include some general knowledge questions, math games, language game, brand guessing game, spell checker game and possiably a colour game. Each game will be very simple and fast paced. 

We have a new set of tasks for each of us to do this week. Our tasks are on our _Trello_ site. These tasks include drawing logo on illustrator, blog entries, game wireframes, color schemes on the frontend. On the back end the boys will have a look at scotchIO tutorials and the log in button

Myself and Sinead sat down and discussed possible colour palettes. We decided on  flat ui design colors as we felt they would best suit our site. They are very minimal yet effective. We had a look on [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/) and also [Flat Colors](http://flatcolors.net/palettes) for some colour inspiration.
