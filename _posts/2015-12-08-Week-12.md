##Week 12

This week we couldnt meet up because we were all very busy. I worked on our presentation just to get a heads start. Our presentation is on Thursday 10th. This leaves us with less time then everyone else.

I worked on our powerpoint and what each of us will be talking about.

I will start off by explaing what is Plazarama and how does it work.

Alex will then talk about all the technology that we have used and why have used them.

Robert will talk about what we have done so far.

Sinead will speak about what we plan to do after christmas.

We will then give a a demo of our project.

The userprofile page and the index page are fully completed now.
