This is our blog entry for weeks 1-6 for our project.

**Week 1:**

This was our first official team meeting for our project. We organized a meeting place and talked thoroughly about any ideas we wanted to bring to the rest of the groups attention. Some of the ideas included an organisation website for students, a price comparison website and a betting website. At the end of the session we had narrowed it down to the organisation site.

**Week 4:**

Alex joined our group and had lots of ideas for our project. We decided to do a plotter type project however then we all agreed it would be too difficult in our short timeframe. We then dissuced different ideas.

We settled on a web application game. Alex came up with the intial idea for our project. It is an online mulitplayer and multiscreen game. 

We met with our supervisor _(Fergal Keane)_ to discuss our project and he gave us some advice on what was required of the project.

We met up as a group today and finalised the project charter. We also did our user stories. We came up with quite a few user stories and this allowed us to understand and rethink a few things for our project. We have also done out our wireframes for our site. We set out tasks to be completed for next week.
