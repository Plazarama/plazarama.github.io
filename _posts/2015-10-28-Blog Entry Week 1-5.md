This is our blog entry for weeks 1-6 for our project.

**Week 1:**

This was our first official team meeting for our project. We organized a meeting place and talked thoroughly about any ideas we wanted to bring to the rest of the groups attention. Some of the ideas included an organisation website for students, a price comparison website and a betting website. At the end of the session we had narrowed it down to the organisation site. We felt this would be most appropriate for the project 
as it applies to students and we would be familiar with what this project should include
to meet the needs of students. We decided it should be a website with social media aspects but also simaler to moodle and what that provides.

We discussed what we would be capable to do as a team. as me and Aisling knew our capabilities and have worked together in previous projects we realised we needed a good hand on the back end so we met with robert to see what he could do. were missing a fourth member of the team so me and aisling have emailed Kieth to see if there is anyone without a team and could join us.

Myself and Sinead met with Keith to discuss a possible 4th member joining our group. He said he would get back to us. So little progress what made this week.

Me and Ailsing met with keith. We cannot progress in anyways with the project without a fourth member but we are constantly talking over our idea and any flaws that could come with it. We have just heard there is foreign exchange students that are over and would be needing a group. Am delighted as i no they will be a great asset. So sitting and waiting until we hear more.

**Week 4:**

Alex joined our group and had lots of ideas for our project. We decided to do a plotter type project. However we all agreed that it would be too difficult in our short timeframe because this project would involve a lot of object oriented code and we wanted to do something with more client side work, this woud also invole using hardware we were not familiar with which would also need to be funded. We then dissuced different ideas.

We settled on a web application game. Alex came up with the intial idea for our project. It is an online mulitplayer and multiscreen game. Everyone had alot of different ideas for game we should make we thought it should be something easy going and simple to attract people to play it. We also discussed doing multiple games in the application.

We met with our supervisor _(Fergal Keane)_ to discuss our project and he gave us some advice on what was required of the project.

Delighted with the new team member he really has some knowledge of alot of technologies and really seems to be a great worker. Alex decided on a multiplayer multiscreen game. i think its a great idea as it will bring fun and enjoyment (after completion of course!)
We have discussed diffrent type games together as a group. Possibility of adding a mutidude of games. Fergal met with us to discuss what we thought. he seemed quite scepticle about the idea at first but think he sees the potential in Alex and what a great asset he is to the team. Feeling positive!

We met up as a group today and finalised the project charter. We also did our user stories. We came up with quite a few user stories and this allowed us to understand and rethink a few things for our project. We have also done out our wireframes for our game site. We set out tasks to be completed for next week.

This week we set out tasks to be done. Myself and Sinead decided to come up with an idea for a name. We discussed a few ideas for names and we came up with the name "Plazarama".

This week we also got out _Github_ accounts set up and Alex gave us a quick tutorial on the basics of github. (Sinead got a spider in her hair aswell, made my meeting hahaha)

Alex also quickly went through _Express.js_ & _Node.js._

We also set up out _Slack_ account which is a good as it  brings all our communication together in one place. We also set up a _Trello_ page to keep track of all our tasks.
