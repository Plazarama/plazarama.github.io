##Week 9 
We haven't got much done the past 2 weeks as we all have been busy with other college assigments. 

We have been speaking on Slack and decided that For example in the Speller game the two screens should look similar. However the Math game for example could say only the question in the server screen and the answers in the client screen.

We then decided that if we add the answers to the server aswell it can call the attention of the people who are around (the people not playing) because they can see the answers and try to guess the correct one.

We then decided on the end we should have the server and client screen looking the same.

I also have designed our index in bootstrap and that it complete.
