**Blog Post Week 13**

PRESENTATION WEEK

On Thursday we will have our presentation on front of the lectures for Plazarama. We met up with Fergal on Monday and just talked us through the layout of the presentation and the possiable questions that could be asked.

Today(Tuesday) we met up as a team to go over the presentation. We broke it all down in to pieces and took out unnecessary stuff. We each wrote out a piece of what we are going to say and we are going to learn it so we have a far idea of what to say on Thursday. 

We are going to meet again tomorrow to finalise the presentation and over go it. We have also prepared sample questions to ask each other. 

_I will update later in the week_

This week we spent reviewing what we have done so far and what we still need to do to prepare for questions we will be asked in the presentation.
