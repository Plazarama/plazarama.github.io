## A New Post

As backend are getting together stats and results page we are having conflict in the css. we have gathered together to play the game and ive taken notes on every flaw in it. Me and Aislinf have divided this up and set a time limit ot complete. We are being extremely strict on ourselves at the minute as we are so dlose to the end. Having Andy on the backend has made it so much easier for Plazarama to progress. Me and aisling have spent an hour or 2 each evening so far getting the report completed passing it back and forth getting extra thoughts as we did. this has made for a great group report so far. 

The next 2 weeks now are spent every minute getting Plazarama our presentation and the report done to the best possible game we can. Feeling so positive working great with my team.
