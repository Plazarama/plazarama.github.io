##Week 11

This we I gave all the pages the same look and feel. I worked on the index page again to give it a smooth and concise layout. We went with flat design. We wanted to keep it mimimal and simple so the user wouldn't have to navigate through loads of pages. Each poage just flows into one another. 

I also worked on our user profile page to give it the same look and feel as the index page. We also had a quick meeting with fergal and he explained what would be needed in our presentation.

I worked on the waiting page and the actual question this week. We decided as a team that we would give each page a simple layout. We also decided that it would be a good idea to add in a game with pictures so that it draws the user in a lot more. For example On our general knowledge quiz we could have a picture of a celebraity and it would say "Guess the person".

Worked on the login part of the page. So you will be able to login through facebook. If you don't have a facebook account you will be able to log in as a guest. We got both the login as guest and login as a facebook user working.
