## Blog Entry Week 22

We met up to discuss the look and feel of the stats page. We  have done a few hand drawn wireframes of what we think the stats page should look like. We have found out we are gaining another team member Andy from Taiwan. Me and Aisling actually know Andy as hes in our class. we know hes going to be great for plazarama.
Feeling good
