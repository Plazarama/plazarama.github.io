## Blog Entry Week 22

We met up to discuss the look and feel of the stats page. We  have done a few hand drawn wireframes of what we think the stats page should look like. We need to show these to the backend to see what they can acheove with what our thought process is

Unfortunately we have lost our team member Aex who has gone to Germany and wont be comign back. Its unsure wether he will be helpig with Plazarama due to his own work so we will have to wait. We are feeling very tense at the minute.

Drew out quick mockups for the results and stats page to gain a further understanding of what we want to achieve.
