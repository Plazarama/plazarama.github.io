This week we met with Fergal and dissuced everything we need to get done. We have the phones hooked up properly working again.

We have spoken about the scoring. The scoring will work by when you get a question right you will get 2 points. If you get the question incorrect/dont answer you will get 0 points. If the points are a draw at the end there will be a quick flash fire question worth 4 points and who ever gets the answer will win.

I have added in an Add question page where the user will be able to add in their own personalise question to the database. I have now added it over to robert where he will begin to hook it up.
